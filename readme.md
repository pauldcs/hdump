Listen well, young hunter!
To unlock the enigmas concealed within a file's essence,
wield the `xdp` command, and bestow upon it the name of the file.

Should you yearn to gaze upon a specific range of bytes therein,
unfurl the `-r` option with an expression of your desire.
The command shall reveal all that lies within the specified range,
as precise as your calculation may require.

If perchance you seek to embark on your journey from a certain byte,
call forth the `-s` option, and behold the offset expressed.
The starting point is, by default, at naught.

Behold, hunter, that the `-r` and `-s` options can accept arithmetic
expressions as arguments, allowing you to navigate the file's realm
with great finesse.

Moreover, for your convenience,
the values provided for byte offsets and ranges can be expressed in
the sacred tongue of hexadecimal notation.

To recall guidance, summon the `-h` option.
May the revelations bestowed by this command illuminate your path
as you tread through the enigmatic depths of the file.
