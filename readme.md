# Listen well, young hunter

With the `xdp` command, unlock the secrets that lie dormant
within the heart of a file. Speak its name, and behold the
hidden knowledge that awaits.

Should you wish to peer into a specific range of bytes,
unfurl the `-r` option, and behold the treasures that lie within.
Let your calculations guide you,
for the command shall reveal all that you desire.

And should you seek to embark on your journey from a certain
byte, call forth the `-s` option, and behold the offset expressed.
The starting point is, by default, at naught.

But beware, traveler, for the `-r` and `-s` options can also
accept the power of arithmetic expressions. Let your calculations
flow like a river, and the command shall follow your every whim.
And for your convenience, the values provided for byte offsets
and ranges can be expressed in the sacred tongue of hexadecimal
notation.

But that is not all, noble explorer! The command also possesses
the power of memory usage tracking. Its secrets can guide you on
your journey, aiding you in your quest to improve the command's
performance and bring glory to your name.
And should you wish to contribute to its further development,
let the memory usage tracking system, `xleaks` be your guide.

Invoke the `-h` option at any time to summon guidance,
and let the command's revelations illuminate your path as you
delve into the enigmatic depths of the file.
