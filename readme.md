# Listen well, young hunter...

Seeker of forbidden knowledge, heed the call of the `xdp` command,
for it is a gateway to the very depths of the unknown.
With a whisper of a filename, the command shall stir,
its arcane might unleashed to reveal the secrets buried within.

Should you seek to embark on your journey from a certain
byte, call forth the `-o` option, and behold the offset expressed.
The starting point is, by default, at naught.

Let not the sheer volume of information intimidate you, for with
the power of the `-n` option, you shall control the very boundaries
of what is revealed. 

Beware, traveler, for the `-n` and `-o` options can also
accept the power of arithmetic expressions. Let your calculations
flow like a river, and the command shall follow your every whim.
And for your convenience, the values provided for byte offsets
and ranges can be expressed in the sacred tongue of hexadecimal
notation.

Invoke the `-h` option to seek guidance, and let the command's
revelations illuminate your path as you delve into the enigmatic
depths of the file, cloaked in the shadows of obscurity.
Yet fear not, for with the aid of `xdp`, the veil may be lifted,
and the arcane knowledge within may be revealed.

But that is not all, noble explorer! For within its very core lies
the ancient ability to track the memory usage of your journey,
guiding you ever closer to the truth.
And should your heart yearn to contribute to its eternal expansion,
the memory usage tracking system `xleaks` shall be your ally. 

But heed this warning, oh seeker of truth: the secrets that lie hidden
within may be too great for mere mortals to bear, and the power that
they bestow may come at a great cost. So venture forth with caution
and let the wisdom gained be used to enlighten and uplift, rather
than to destroy and corrupt. For in the end, it is not the knowledge
itself that holds the true power, but how it is wielded by those
who dare to seek it.
